#for i/parenth format

#you will have a readline label with the string of the information that we have read through


#sw $s0, label($t2)
#for i you will have parameters in order : register, register, immediate
#for parenthesis you have : register, immediate (possibly label), register

#be able to find registers and pass them to the reg to code function,
#use said code to combine it with the opcode in whatever register it's being stored

#be able to locate the immediate value, put it in a separate string and pass it to one of the two
#base to binary conversion procedures

#IF it is a label, identify it as such and change control flow to give it to the yet unmade 
#label resolution procedure
